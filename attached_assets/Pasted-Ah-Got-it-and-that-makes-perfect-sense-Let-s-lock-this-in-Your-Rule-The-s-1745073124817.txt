Ah! Got it ‚Äî and that makes perfect sense. Let‚Äôs lock this in:

---

### ‚úÖ Your Rule:
- The **spreadsheet should keep clean county names** like `"Prince of Wales-Hyder"` (no underscores).
- **Only the SVG color logic** should normalize county names using `"_"`.

That way:
- ‚úÖ The user sees readable names in the spreadsheet.
- ‚úÖ The backend still finds and colors matching SVG paths correctly.

---

### ‚úÖ Solution (Targeted Normalization for SVG Matching Only)

We'll use a helper function **only during the SVG coloring step**:

```python
def normalize_county_id(name):
    return name.lower().replace(" ", "_").replace("-", "_").replace(".", "").replace("'", "")
```

### üß± Updated `build_county_color_map()` to Keep Display Names Intact, but Match SVG:

```python
def build_county_color_map(df, dem_colors, rep_colors, ind_colors):
    color_map = {}
    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        county = str(row.get("County", "")).strip()
        rating = str(row.get("Rating", "")).strip()

        if not county or not rating:
            continue

        try:
            strength, party = rating.split()
            if party == "Democratic":
                color = dem_colors.get(strength, "#cccccc")
            elif party == "Republican":
                color = rep_colors.get(strength, "#cccccc")
            else:
                color = ind_colors.get(strength, "#cccccc")

            # Only normalize here for internal map use
            county_id = normalize_county_id(county)
            color_map[county_id] = color
        except:
            continue

    return color_map
```

---

### üñçÔ∏è Your `apply_county_colors_to_svg()` stays the same ‚Äî it uses those normalized keys to match `id="..."`.

This way:
- Your spreadsheets remain readable
- Coloring logic becomes flexible and robust
- You avoid the messy look of `county_name_like_this` in the UI

### ‚úÖ Let‚Äôs Test
Would you like me to help patch your `main.py` with this logic, or are you ready to drop this in and try again?
