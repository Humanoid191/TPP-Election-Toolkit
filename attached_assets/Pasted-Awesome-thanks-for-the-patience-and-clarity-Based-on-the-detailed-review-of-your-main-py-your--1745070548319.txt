Awesome â€” thanks for the patience and clarity! Based on the detailed review of your `main.py`, your instincts are absolutely right: the easiest and cleanest way to color maps is to **read from the spreadsheet display (`df_display`)**, since:

- âœ… It already has every state/county and their calculated margin/rating
- âœ… Itâ€™s consistently structured
- âœ… It lets you avoid direct dependency on raw game JSON

---

### âœ… What Weâ€™ll Do Next

1. **Extract coloring instructions from `df_display`**
   - For national view: use `"State"` and `"Rating"` columns
   - For county-level view: use `"County"` and `"Rating"` columns
2. **Match regions in the SVG by ID or name**
   - SVG elements are likely named like `id="wi"` for states or `id="milwaukee"` for counties
3. **Inject `fill="{color}"` into each matching `<path>` or `<g>` tag**

### ðŸ§± Step 1: Build the Color Mapper

Weâ€™ll write a helper function that:
- Reads `df_display`
- Classifies each row into a color
- Returns a `dict` mapping region â†’ hex color

```python
def build_region_color_map(df, level, dem_colors, rep_colors, ind_colors):
    """
    level: "state" or "county"
    df: the df_display DataFrame
    Returns: dict of region_id â†’ hex_color
    """
    region_col = "State" if level == "state" else "County"
    rating_col = "Rating"

    color_map = {}

    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        region = row.get(region_col)
        rating = str(row.get(rating_col)).strip()

        if not region or not rating:
            continue

        try:
            strength, party = rating.split()
            if party == "Democratic":
                color = dem_colors.get(strength, "#cccccc")
            elif party == "Republican":
                color = rep_colors.get(strength, "#cccccc")
            else:
                color = ind_colors.get(strength, "#cccccc")

            region_id = region.lower().replace(" ", "").replace(".", "")  # e.g., "New York" â†’ "newyork"
            color_map[region_id] = color
        except Exception:
            continue  # skip malformed rows

    return color_map
```

---

### ðŸ”œ Next Step:
Once thatâ€™s built, weâ€™ll:
- Read the raw SVG file
- Replace matching `id="{region}"` fills with the computed color
- Display the updated SVG
