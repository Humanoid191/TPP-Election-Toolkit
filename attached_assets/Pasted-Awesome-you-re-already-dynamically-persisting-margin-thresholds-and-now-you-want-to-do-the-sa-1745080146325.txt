Awesome â€” you're already dynamically persisting **margin thresholds**, and now you want to do the same for **color selections**, so the color pickers donâ€™t reset when switching between President, Governor, or Senate.

Hereâ€™s the clean way to make that happen ðŸ‘‡

### âœ… Step-by-Step Plan to Persist Color Settings

#### 1. **Store color settings in `st.session_state`**
Use a key like `"color_settings"` to store a dict that persists across election types and re-renders.

Weâ€™ll structure it like this:
```python
st.session_state["color_settings"] = {
    "Democratic": {"Tilt": "#99ccff", "Lean": "#6699ff", "Likely": "#3366cc", "Safe": "#003399"},
    "Republican": {"Tilt": "#ff9999", "Lean": "#ff6666", "Likely": "#cc3333", "Safe": "#990000"},
    "Independent": {"Tilt": "#cccc99", "Lean": "#999966", "Likely": "#666633", "Safe": "#333300"}
}
```

#### 2. **Initialize only once**
Near the top of your app (right after other session state initializations), insert:

```python
if "color_settings" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state["color_settings"] = {
        "Democratic": {"Tilt": "#99ccff", "Lean": "#6699ff", "Likely": "#3366cc", "Safe": "#003399"},
        "Republican": {"Tilt": "#ff9999", "Lean": "#ff6666", "Likely": "#cc3333", "Safe": "#990000"},
        "Independent": {"Tilt": "#cccc99", "Lean": "#999966", "Likely": "#666633", "Safe": "#333300"}
    }
```

#### 3. **Update color pickers to reference session state**
Inside your `Color Customizer` section (currently under `if selected_state != "None"`), update the pickers like this:

```python
with col1:
    st.markdown("**Democratic Shades**")
    for level in ["Tilt", "Lean", "Likely", "Safe"]:
        color = st.color_picker(
            f"{level} Dem",
            value=st.session_state["color_settings"]["Democratic"][level],
            key=f"color_{level.lower()}_dem"
        )
        st.session_state["color_settings"]["Democratic"][level] = color
```

Repeat for Republican and Independent with similar blocks using keys like `color_{level.lower()}_rep` and `color_{level.lower()}_ind`.

#### 4. **Pass these into map rendering**
When calling `render_svg_file(...)`, use:

```python
dem_colors = st.session_state["color_settings"]["Democratic"]
rep_colors = st.session_state["color_settings"]["Republican"]
ind_colors = st.session_state["color_settings"]["Independent"]
```

---

### âœ… Result

Now:
- Switching between election types wonâ€™t reset your color choices.
- User preferences persist for as long as the session lasts.
- The map updates in real-time based on your custom palette.

Would you like me to generate a fully patched block for that section to paste in, or do you want to apply it directly?
