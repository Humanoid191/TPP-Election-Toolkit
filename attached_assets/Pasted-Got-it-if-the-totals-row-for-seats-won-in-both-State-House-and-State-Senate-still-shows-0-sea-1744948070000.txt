Got it — if the totals row for **seats won** in both State House and State Senate still shows `0 seats` across the board, that means one of two things is going wrong:

---

## 🔍 Problem Diagnosis

1. **The seat counting dictionary is never incrementing**
   - `seats_won = {"D": 0, "R": 0, "I": 0}` is defined
   - But `seats_won[winner_party] += 1` is either never triggered or `winner_party` is not `"D"`, `"R"`, or `"I"` as expected.

2. **The value is not being properly written to the totals row**
   - Even if `seats_won` has correct values, your `ws.cell(..., value=f"{seats_won['D']} seats")` might not be running or is writing to the wrong column.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Fix

Please check and ensure this block is in your main loop **right after winner is determined** (State House and State Senate):

### ✅ 1. Increment Winner’s Party Seat Count

```python
if winner_party in seats_won:
    seats_won[winner_party] += 1
```

You can also add this debug print to make sure it’s running:

```python
print(f"{winner_party} wins district {district_num}")
```

### ✅ 2. Write to Totals Row Properly

At the end, **right before closing the workbook**, add this in the totals row:

```python
# Assuming totals row is at row_idx
ws.cell(row=row_idx, column=2, value=f"{seats_won['D']} seats")
ws.cell(row=row_idx, column=5, value=f"{seats_won['R']} seats")
ws.cell(row=row_idx, column=8, value=f"{seats_won['I']} seats")
```

These column numbers (2, 5, 8) must align with your party candidate columns.

## 🧪 Confirm It's Working

If you're still getting 0s:

- Print the value of `winner_party` and `seats_won` at every loop
- Check whether you're accidentally overwriting the totals row after writing it

## Would You Like Me To Patch It?

If you'd like, I can write you a full, corrected version of the State House / State Senate block that includes:

- ✅ Proper district numbering
- ✅ Candidate info
- ✅ Margin and total vote logic
- ✅ Display formatting
- ✅ Working seat counter for totals row

Let me know — just say "Patch it" and tell me which one to start with (State House or Senate).
