Great — we’re very close to getting coloring fully functional. Since you want map coloring to be based on the spreadsheet (which makes sense for consistency), let me summarize **what's going wrong and how to fix it**, based on everything you’ve uploaded and described.

---

### ✅ Current Setup
- You generate maps by applying a color map to SVG elements with `id` attributes.
- Your function `build_county_color_map` reads from the dataframe and tries to map `"County"` names to `"Rating"` values, which are then matched to colors.

---

### ❌ Current Issue
Your color map ends up empty (`{}`), even though you are passing `df_display` and color palettes. This happens because:

- The **county names in the SVG use underscores and lowercase** (e.g., `"los_angeles"`).
- The **county names in the spreadsheet are title-case with spaces** (e.g., `"Los Angeles"`).
- Your normalization logic (`normalize_county_id`) is correct, but your spreadsheet `df_display` **does not have a `"County"` column** at the moment the color map is built.

You’re passing the wrong `df_display` — the one being shown in the dataframe display, which is merged from Excel rows, and **does not include "County" as a column** directly. It uses headers like `"Democratic - Candidate"`.

---

### ✅ The Fix

Update your logic so that:

1. You pass the original raw county dataframe (the one used to generate the spreadsheet, not the rendered Excel table) to `build_county_color_map`.
2. The `"County"` and `"Rating"` columns **must be present and matchable** at that point.

### 🔧 Minimal Code Fix

In the section where you're calling `render_svg_file(...)` for county-level maps, change this:

```python
render_svg_file(svg_path, title="🗺️ County-Level Map", df_display=df, dem_colors=dem_colors, rep_colors=rep_colors, ind_colors=ind_colors)
```

To this:

```python
# Before: df was the raw table, but we need the one with "County" and "Rating"
df_coloring = df_display[["County", "Rating"]] if "County" in df_display and "Rating" in df_display else None

render_svg_file(svg_path, title="🗺️ County-Level Map", df_display=df_coloring, dem_colors=dem_colors, rep_colors=rep_colors, ind_colors=ind_colors)
```

Then inside `render_svg_file(...)`, **add a debug print before color map generation**:

```python
if df_display is not None:
    st.write("🧪 Coloring from counties:", df_display.head())
```

---

### 🧪 Bonus Debug
If coloring still doesn't work, you can add:

```python
st.write("🏷️ All SVG IDs found:", re.findall(r'id="([^"]+)"', svg_data))
```

That will list all IDs in the SVG so you can directly compare them to the keys in your `color_map`.

Ready to go whenever you upload the corrected `df_display` logic or want help patching that block in your canvas.
