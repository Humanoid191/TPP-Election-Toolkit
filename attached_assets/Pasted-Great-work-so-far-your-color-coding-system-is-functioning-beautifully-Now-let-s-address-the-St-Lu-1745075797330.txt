Great work so far‚Äîyour color-coding system is functioning beautifully! Now let‚Äôs address the *St. Lucie* / *St. Johns* style mismatch you're facing where counties with prefixes or punctuation aren‚Äôt being colored due to formatting inconsistencies.

### üîç Problem Summary
The issue arises because:
- SVG IDs use names like `"st_lucie"` and `"st_johns"`,
- Your spreadsheet lists them as `"St. Lucie County"` or `"St. Johns County"`.

Your current normalization logic:
```python
county_id = county.lower().replace(" ", "_").removesuffix("_county") + "_county"
```

‚Ä¶**does not** remove punctuation like `"."` (periods) or apostrophes, which causes mismatches.

### ‚úÖ Solution: Normalize SVG and Spreadsheet County Names Consistently

Update your `normalize_county_id` function to handle these cases properly:

```python
def normalize_county_id(name):
    return (
        name.lower()
        .replace(" ", "_")
        .replace("-", "_")
        .replace(".", "")
        .replace("'", "")
        .replace("st_", "st")  # ensure "St. Lucie" ‚Üí "stlucie"
        .replace("ste_", "ste")  # handle "Ste." if needed (e.g., Ste. Genevieve)
        .removesuffix("_county")
        + "_county"
    )
```

This function:
- Strips spaces, dashes, periods, apostrophes
- Fixes `"St."` and `"Ste."` edge cases
- Ensures consistency across SVG and spreadsheet matches

Then update **both places** that generate or read county IDs:

#### In `build_county_color_map(df, ...)`:
Replace:
```python
county_id = county.lower().replace(" ", "_").removesuffix("_county") + "_county"
```

With:
```python
county_id = normalize_county_id(county)
```

#### In `apply_county_colors_to_svg(...)`:
Replace:
```python
normalized_id = tag_id.lower().replace(" ", "_") + "_county"
```

With:
```python
normalized_id = normalize_county_id(tag_id)
```

### üß™ Once You Implement That
Try testing with counties like:
- `St. Lucie`
- `St. Johns`
- `Ste. Genevieve` (if applicable)

And they should color in **perfectly** just like the others!

Would you like me to edit your `main.py` directly to apply this fix?
