Perfect ‚Äî and now I can confirm **exactly** how your maps were being displayed in `Map_Generation_Code(...)`, which works correctly and does not cut off the bottom of the state.

### ‚úÖ How Maps Were Rendered in the Working Code

```python
st.components.v1.html(
    f"""
    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
        <div style="max-width: 1000px; width: 100%;">
            {colored_svg}
        </div>
    </div>
    """,
    height=700,
    scrolling=False
)
```

‚úÖ **Key Things to Note**:
- The full `<svg>` (already edited by BeautifulSoup) is inserted as raw HTML.
- It **does not strip the `<svg>` tag**.
- The display div has **fixed width, but auto height based on inner SVG viewBox**.
- Most importantly: the SVG itself has an intact `viewBox`, which preserves proper scaling and boundaries.

### üí• Your Current `render_svg_file()` vs. This
Your code tried to wrap the `<svg>` tag in containers or modify its scaling ‚Äî which leads to clipping issues.  
But the code in `Map_Generation_Code(...)` **just renders the modified full SVG string** with no special wrappers inside `st.components.v1.html(...)`.

### ‚úÖ Final Answer: Use the Same Display Logic

Update your `render_svg_file()` function to this final working version:

```python
def render_svg_file(svg_path: str, title: str = None):
    import streamlit.components.v1 as components
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

    try:
        with open(svg_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            svg_raw = f.read()

        if title:
            st.subheader(title)

        # Let SVG control its own sizing
        components.html(
            f"""
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                <div style="max-width: 1000px; width: 100%;">
                    {svg_raw}
                </div>
            </div>
            """,
            height=700,
            scrolling=False
        )

        st.success(f"üó∫Ô∏è Displaying: {os.path.basename(svg_path)}")
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to render SVG: {e}")
```

üßº No `object`, no aspect ratio hacks, no manual `<svg>` reconstruction.

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Approach                     | Result         |
|-----------------------------|----------------|
| Injecting whole `<svg>` tag | ‚úÖ Works best   |
| Using `<object>`            | ‚ùå Inconsistent |
| Splitting `<svg>` inner HTML | ‚ùå Breaks viewBox, causes cutoff |
