Thank you — I’ve reviewed the full, current version of `main.py`, and here's a clear breakdown of the issue and the exact fix.

---

## 🔍 Problem Summary

You're clicking on states in the **national SVG map**, and:
- The mouse changes to a pointer ✅
- The SVG gets embedded correctly ✅
- You *expect* it to switch to that state’s view ❌

### But it doesn’t.

This is because:

> `window.parent.document.querySelector('select[aria-label="Select State"]')` doesn't work — the Streamlit iframe doesn't expose the DOM this way.

---

## ✅ The Real Fix: Bridge Clicks via `localStorage` → `st_javascript`

You **already have** the right idea — but one part of the logic is missing:

- You're adding this inside the iframe:
  ```js
  window.parent.postMessage(...)
  ```

But Streamlit **doesn't let iframe JS modify parent DOM** directly.

Instead, you should:
1. Inject `onclick="localStorage.setItem('clicked_state', 'West Virginia')"` into each state
2. Poll for that value in `st_javascript()`
3. Trigger the rerun with that `clicked_state`

---

## 🧠 Here's Exactly What You Do

---

### ✅ 1. Modify `add_click_handler()` to set `localStorage` directly

In your `render_svg_file()` function, find this part:

```python
def add_click_handler(match):
    tag = match.group(0)
    state_code = match.group(2)
    state_name = state_code_to_name.get(state_code.upper(), "")
    if state_name:
        onclick = f'onclick="localStorage.setItem(\'clicked_state\', \'{state_name}\')"'
        if 'style="' in tag:
            tag = tag.replace('style="', f'{onclick} style="cursor: pointer; ')
        else:
            tag = tag.replace('>', f' {onclick} style="cursor: pointer;">')
    return tag
```

This is **correct** — you do **not** need to use `postMessage`.

---

### ✅ 2. Remove all `window.postMessage` blocks

In the HTML injected inside `render_svg_file()`, **remove** this block:

```html
<script>
window.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
    if (e.data.type === 'selectState') {
        const selectBox = window.parent.document.querySelector(...);
        ...
    }
});
</script>
```

You don’t need it anymore. It won’t work in Streamlit’s sandbox anyway.

---

### ✅ 3. Add persistent polling to check for the click

Somewhere early in the Streamlit file (e.g., after `st.set_page_config()`), add this logic:

```python
clicked_state = st_javascript("""
    const clicked = localStorage.getItem('clicked_state');
    if (clicked) {
        localStorage.removeItem('clicked_state');
    }
    return clicked;
""")

if clicked_state:
    st.session_state["selected_state"] = clicked_state
    st.experimental_rerun()
```

This ensures:  
✔️ If the user clicks a state  
✔️ It saves in `localStorage`  
✔️ Streamlit sees it  
✔️ And reruns to show the county view for that state

---

### ✅ 4. Double-check this key line in `selected_state` selectbox:

```python
index=state_options.index(st.session_state.get("selected_state", "National View")),
```

This should already trigger your logic to display the correct county view when the state is selected.

---

## ✅ Summary

| Step | What to Change |
|------|----------------|
| 1 | `onclick="localStorage.setItem(...)"` in SVG — ✅ already there |
| 2 | Delete all `window.parent.postMessage` logic from your injected HTML |
| 3 | Add `st_javascript(...)` to read `clicked_state` from `localStorage` |
| 4 | Assign to `st.session_state["selected_state"]` and call `st.experimental_rerun()` |

Would you like me to cleanly patch this into your current code and return a working version of the function?
