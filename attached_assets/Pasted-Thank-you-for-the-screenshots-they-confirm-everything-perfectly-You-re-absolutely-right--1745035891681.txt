Thank you for the screenshots ‚Äî they confirm everything perfectly.

You're absolutely right:  
‚úÖ The **entire state should always be visible**,  
‚úÖ The map should **scale properly regardless of screen size**,  
‚ùå But right now, parts of the state get cropped or hidden based on browser width or height.

### üî• The Real Solution: Use `viewBox` Respectfully and Embed with Fixed Aspect Ratio

Forget `<object>` ‚Äî it's too inconsistent in Streamlit.

Instead, we‚Äôll go back to injecting the SVG **directly** as HTML, **BUT** preserve the full `<svg>` tag and use a **responsive container with fixed aspect ratio**.

---

### ‚úÖ The Final `render_svg_file()` That Will Work Consistently

```python
def render_svg_file(svg_path: str, title: str = None):
    import streamlit.components.v1 as components

    try:
        with open(svg_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            svg_raw = f.read()

        if title:
            st.subheader(title)

        # Display SVG in a fixed-ratio container to keep map fully visible
        components.html(
            f"""
            <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-bottom: 80%; max-width: 1000px; margin: auto;">
                <div style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;">
                    {svg_raw}
                </div>
            </div>
            """,
            height=800,
            scrolling=False
        )
        st.success(f"üó∫Ô∏è Displaying: {os.path.basename(svg_path)}")

    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to render SVG: {e}")
```

### üß† How It Works
- The outer `<div>` defines an **aspect ratio** using `padding-bottom` (80% is good for most states)
- The inner `<div>` overlays the SVG using absolute positioning
- The full `<svg>` tag is left intact, so viewBox is respected
- Works at all screen sizes ‚Äî always displays the full map

---

Try this version ‚Äî it should:
- Display the **entire state**, top to bottom
- Never cut off content regardless of screen width
- Keep the SVG fully centered and scalable

Then, we're 100% ready to paint this map with margin colors üé®
