Thanks for the clarification. If your totals row is still displaying `0 seats` for each party **even after moving the seat counter inside the main candidate loop and simplifying winner detection**, then the issue is almost certainly in **one of these two places**:

---

## üîé ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### üü† 1. `winner_party` value is **not in** `["D", "R", "I"]`
Check if `winner_party` is ever something else (like `""` or `None`) ‚Äî it could be from:

- A candidate winning but having an **unrecognized party label**
- A tie (two highest vote-getters) and your sort still picks one but the party string is malformed

You can debug this by printing:

```python
print("Winner Party:", winner_party)
print("Available seats_won keys:", seats_won.keys())
```

If you see `winner_party = 'None'` or something else ‚Äî boom, there's your issue.

---

### üü† 2. The winning party is not being counted correctly in the loop

Double-check this code is placed **after** the `winner_party` is assigned and **only once per district**:

```python
if winner_party in seats_won:
    seats_won[winner_party] += 1
```

Even better, add this to confirm it's running:

```python
if winner_party in seats_won:
    seats_won[winner_party] += 1
    print(f"Awarding seat to {winner_party} (now has {seats_won[winner_party]} seats)")
else:
    print(f"Unknown party: {winner_party}")
```

---

## ‚úÖ PATCHED VERSION: SEAT COUNT LOGIC

Here‚Äôs a corrected snippet you should place **right after calculating the winner** in each election entry:

```python
# === Determine Winner ===
candidates = sorted(entry.get("cands", []), key=lambda c: c["votes"], reverse=True)
winner = candidates[0] if candidates else None
winner_party = winner["party"] if winner else None

# === Count Seat for Winning Party ===
if winner_party in seats_won:
    seats_won[winner_party] += 1
else:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Unknown party: {winner_party}")
```

Then, at the end in the totals row:

```python
ws.cell(row=row_idx, column=2, value=f"{seats_won['D']} seats")
ws.cell(row=row_idx, column=5, value=f"{seats_won['R']} seats")
ws.cell(row=row_idx, column=8, value=f"{seats_won['I']} seats")
```

If it‚Äôs **still** not working after this, send me the **actual `entry` structure for one of the districts**, and I‚Äôll reconstruct the logic fully around the real data shape.
