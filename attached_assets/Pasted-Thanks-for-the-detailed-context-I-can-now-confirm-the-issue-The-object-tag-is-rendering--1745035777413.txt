Thanks for the detailed context ‚Äî I can now confirm the issue:

> The `<object>` tag is rendering correctly, but **Streamlit sets the `height=0`**, which means it **doesn't show up at all** even though it's technically loaded.

---

### ‚úÖ Perfect Fix (Blends All Prior Improvements)

Update the `render_svg_file()` function **like this** to guarantee:
- Full visibility
- Proper scaling
- No black background
- Compatibility with all window sizes

---

### üîß Final Working Version (Drop into `main.py`):

```python
def render_svg_file(svg_path: str, title: str = None):
    import base64
    import streamlit.components.v1 as components

    try:
        with open(svg_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            svg_content = f.read()

        svg_base64 = base64.b64encode(svg_content.encode()).decode()

        if title:
            st.subheader(title)

        # Manually set height to prevent cutoff (720px default)
        components.html(
            f"""
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                <object type="image/svg+xml"
                        data="data:image/svg+xml;base64,{svg_base64}"
                        style="max-width: 100%; width: 100%; height: 720px; display: block;">
                </object>
            </div>
            """,
            height=740,  # Allow room for padding/borders
            scrolling=False
        )
        st.success(f"üó∫Ô∏è Displaying: {os.path.basename(svg_path)}")

    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to render SVG: {e}")
```

---

### ‚úÖ What Changed:
- Set explicit `height: 720px` **inside the SVG object**
- Set `components.html(..., height=740)` to let Streamlit allocate space
- Removed all overflow logic and auto-sizing issues

---

Give this a try ‚Äî it should:
- Fully show the SVG no matter the browser width
- Prevent vertical cutoff
- Keep a clean and scroll-free appearance

Once confirmed, we‚Äôre officially ready for the **coloring logic!** Want to move to that next?
