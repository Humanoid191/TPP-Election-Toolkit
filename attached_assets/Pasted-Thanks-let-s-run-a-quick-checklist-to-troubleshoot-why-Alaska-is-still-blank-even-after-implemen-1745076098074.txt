Thanks — let’s run a quick checklist to troubleshoot why Alaska is still blank **even after implementing special handling**:

---

### ✅ **1. Confirm Borough Names in the Spreadsheet**
From your past spreadsheet (`AK_Governor_County_Results.xlsx`), can you confirm the `County` column includes entries like:

- `Anchorage Municipality`
- `Wrangell City and Borough`
- `Northwest Arctic Borough`
- `Aleutians East Borough`

If so, good — that’s our input source.

---

### ✅ **2. Confirm SVG Path IDs**
Alaska SVG paths are typically named like:

- `anchorage`
- `wrangell`
- `northwest_arctic`
- `aleutians_east`

So our borough normalization logic should match like this:

```python
def normalize_ak_borough_name(name: str) -> str:
    return (
        name.lower()
        .replace(" census area", "")
        .replace(" city and borough", "")
        .replace(" municipality", "")
        .replace(" borough", "")
        .replace(" ", "_")
        .strip()
    )
```

**Examples:**

- `"Anchorage Municipality"` → `anchorage`
- `"Wrangell City and Borough"` → `wrangell`
- `"Northwest Arctic Borough"` → `northwest_arctic`

---

### ✅ **3. SVG Matching Code**
Ensure this is active **only for Alaska**:

```python
if selected_state.lower() == "alaska":
    county_id = normalize_ak_borough_name(county_name)
else:
    county_id = county_name.lower().replace(" ", "_").replace("county", "").strip()
```

Then build the `color_map` as:

```python
color_map[county_id] = assigned_color
```

---

### ✅ **4. Diagnostic Print (Optional)**
Temporarily output the county IDs you’re trying to color:

```python
st.write("Alaska color map keys:", list(color_map.keys())[:10])
```

If you see nothing or mismatches like `"wrangell_city_and"` or `"wrangell_city_and_borough"` — it's likely an incomplete strip in the normalization.

Would you like me to now generate a cleaned, updated patch you can drop into your `main.py` that handles this borough logic correctly and logs debug output?
