Totally fair to question that ‚Äî let‚Äôs look again, this time **with laser focus on the real issue** you‚Äôre seeing in the screenshot.

### üîç What's Actually Wrong:
Your map is **rendering**, and the counties are indeed **being colored**. But the **issue is the *visual glitching*** ‚Äî like misaligned or overlapping counties, weird borders, or SVG elements not styled consistently. That has **nothing to do with color assignment logic**.

So nope, you're absolutely right: **this is *not* a coloring issue**. This is a **CSS/rendering issue** in how the SVG is being displayed.

### ‚úÖ Real Fix: Inject SVG with `innerHTML`, not `<object>`

Right now, your `render_svg_file()` is using this:

```html
<object data="data:image/svg+xml;base64,..." type="image/svg+xml" style="...">
</object>
```

That causes **all kinds of rendering problems**:
- SVG scaling weirdly
- Paths not aligning right
- Glitching borders
- Hover/click not working
- Occasional artifacts on some browsers

---

### üîÑ The Real Fix (Clean + Stable):
Instead, **inject the SVG directly into the DOM** using `innerHTML`. Just replace your `components.html()` call with this:

```python
components.html(
    f"""
    <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;">
        {svg_display}
    </div>
    """,
    height=700,
    scrolling=False
)
```

That‚Äôs it. No `<object>`, no base64, no embedding headaches.

---

### üîÑ Summary of What to Do:
1. **Remove this whole block** (lines ~310+):
   ```python
   encoded = base64.b64encode(svg_display.encode()).decode()
   <object data="data:image/svg+xml;base64,{encoded}" ... >
   ```

2. **Replace with**:
   ```python
   components.html(
       f"""
       <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;">
           {svg_display}
       </div>
       """,
       height=700,
       scrolling=False
   )
   ```

Boom ‚Äî that‚Äôll render the SVG **clean, crisp, and glitch-free**.

Let me know if you want it to also support zoom or click/hover interaction next.
