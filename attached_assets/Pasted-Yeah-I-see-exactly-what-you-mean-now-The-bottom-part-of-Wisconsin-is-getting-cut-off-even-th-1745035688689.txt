Yeah — I see exactly what you mean now. The **bottom part of Wisconsin is getting cut off**, even though we’ve removed the background and wrapped the SVG nicely.

The issue is this:
> Streamlit’s `components.html(..., height=...)` limits the vertical space shown — and the `<object>` tag doesn’t auto-expand height based on content.

---

### ✅ The Real Fix:
Let the SVG auto-size fully with its natural aspect ratio, and don’t force a `height` on the container.

### 🛠 Replace Your `render_svg_file()` With This Version:

```python
def render_svg_file(svg_path: str, title: str = None):
    import base64
    import streamlit.components.v1 as components

    try:
        with open(svg_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            svg_content = f.read()

        svg_base64 = base64.b64encode(svg_content.encode()).decode()

        if title:
            st.subheader(title)

        components.html(
            f"""
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                <object type="image/svg+xml"
                        data="data:image/svg+xml;base64,{svg_base64}"
                        style="max-width: 100%; width: 100%; height: auto;">
                </object>
            </div>
            """,
            height=0,  # Let browser decide height entirely
            scrolling=False
        )
        st.success(f"🗺️ Displaying: {os.path.basename(svg_path)}")

    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"⚠️ Failed to render SVG: {e}")
```

### 🧠 Explanation
- `height=0` in `components.html` tricks Streamlit into giving **unrestricted vertical height**
- The browser uses **natural aspect ratio** of the SVG
- `object-fit` isn’t needed anymore because the `<object>` itself scales perfectly now

Give that a try — and the **entire state** (including the bottom!) should be visible now regardless of window size.

When ready, we’ll move to coloring counties by their **margin rating** from the spreadsheet.
