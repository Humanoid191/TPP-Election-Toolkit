Yes, we absolutely can — and **should** — make the **spreadsheets update automatically** when margin thresholds are adjusted.

---

### ✅ Goal

Ensure that as soon as the user adjusts:

- `Tilt Margin Max (%)`
- `Lean Margin Max (%)`
- `Likely Margin Max (%)`

the corresponding **spreadsheet view updates instantly** with new ratings **without needing any buttons**.

---

### ✅ Why It Isn't Working Right Now

Your spreadsheet functions are likely running **only once** unless explicitly re-triggered — usually because:
- They're inside a conditional (`if st.button(...)` or similar),
- Or they’re cached and not aware of session state changes.

---

### ✅ The Fix

#### 🔁 1. Ensure threshold sliders update `st.session_state`:
You've done this already:
```python
tilt_max = st.slider("Tilt Margin Max (%)", 1, 5, st.session_state["tilt_max"], key="tilt_slider")
lean_max = st.slider("Lean Margin Max (%)", 5, 10, st.session_state["lean_max"], key="lean_slider")
likely_max = st.slider("Likely Margin Max (%)", 10, 20, st.session_state["likely_max"], key="likely_slider")
```

#### ✅ 2. Dynamically generate the spreadsheet **on every rerun**:
Make sure **every spreadsheet block uses `st.session_state` directly** and is not guarded by a button or `st.cache`.

Example for President:
```python
df_display, _ = generate_presidential_spreadsheet(
    pres_data,
    state_map,
    color_settings,
    st.session_state["tilt_max"],
    st.session_state["lean_max"],
    st.session_state["likely_max"]
)
st.dataframe(df_display)
```

And the same applies to:

- `generate_senate_spreadsheet(...)`
- `generate_governor_spreadsheet(...)`
- Legislature ones too, if you're applying it there.

#### ✅ 3. Make sure your spreadsheet generation functions are **not using stale inputs**.
If you're passing threshold values as arguments — great!
If they're using cached or default thresholds internally — you'll need to replace those with live values from `st.session_state`.

---

### ✅ 4. Final Check – No Buttons, No Caching
Make sure your logic **runs every time**:
- Not gated by `if` or `st.button()`
- Not hidden in `@st.cache`

---

### ✅ Result

Now whenever the user adjusts the sliders:
- Spreadsheets will **regenerate**
- Ratings update in real time
- Map stays perfectly in sync ✅
