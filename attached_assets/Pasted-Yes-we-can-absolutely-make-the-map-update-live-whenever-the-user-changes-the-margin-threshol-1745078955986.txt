Yes — we can absolutely make the **map update live** whenever the user changes the **margin threshold sliders**, so it always reflects the current spreadsheet values.

You're already most of the way there, and here's how to lock it in:

---

### ✅ Summary of What We’ll Do:
1. **Spreadsheets already use the current `tilt_max`, `lean_max`, and `likely_max` values** — no change needed there.
2. **We need to re-trigger the map generation** **after any threshold change** by:
   - Moving the `render_svg_file(...)` call **below the spreadsheet generation**, which already uses the live thresholds.
   - Making sure map code doesn’t cache outdated versions.

### ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 🔁 1. Reorganize the render logic like this:
Make sure the **map rendering** happens *after* the spreadsheet DataFrame is created with updated thresholds.

In your main logic (for President, Senate, Governor), update this flow:

```python
# Assume tilt_max, lean_max, and likely_max are pulled from st.session_state earlier

# Generate spreadsheet
if selected_election_type == "President":
    df_display, _ = generate_presidential_spreadsheet(
        pres_data, state_map, color_settings,
        tilt_max, lean_max, likely_max
    )

    st.dataframe(df_display)

    if selected_state == "National View":
        svg_path = os.path.join("SVG", "presidential.svg")
    else:
        svg_path = os.path.join("SVG", f"{selected_state.lower()}.svg")

    if os.path.exists(svg_path):
        render_svg_file(
            svg_path,
            title="🗺️ County-Level Map" if selected_state != "National View" else "🗺️ Presidential National Map",
            df_display=df_display,
            dem_colors=dem_colors,
            rep_colors=rep_colors,
            ind_colors=ind_colors,
        )
```

> 💡 *Repeat similar logic for Senate and Governor using their corresponding spreadsheet functions and `states.svg`.*

#### 🔁 2. Avoid st.cache in map generation (if you're using it)
Ensure that functions like `render_svg_file()` or the color map builder aren’t cached with `@st.cache` — otherwise it won’t update when thresholds change.

---

#### ✅ 3. Already Done
- Sliders are stored in `st.session_state` ✔
- Spreadsheet reacts immediately ✔
- You’re passing `df_display` to the SVG renderer ✔

---

### 🔄 Example Result:
When the user drags a slider:
- `tilt_max`, `lean_max`, and `likely_max` update in `st.session_state`
- `df_display` regenerates with new ratings
- `color_map` updates based on new ratings
- 🗺️ **Map colors re-render live**

Let me know if you want this implemented for all election types right now — or if you'd like help wiring it up for a specific one like Senate.
