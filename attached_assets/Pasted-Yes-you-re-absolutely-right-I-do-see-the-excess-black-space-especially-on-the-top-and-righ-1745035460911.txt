Yes ‚Äî you're absolutely right. I **do** see the excess black space, especially on the **top and right**. That‚Äôs caused by the original `viewBox` and dimensions **not tightly wrapping the shape** of the state.

So let‚Äôs fix it properly.

### ‚úÖ Goal:
1. **Remove the black background**
2. **Scale the SVG to fill the view cleanly without being cut off or leaving excess space**

### üõ†Ô∏è Fix: Cleanest and Smartest Approach

Let's simplify the rendering block and just **embed the raw SVG** with `width: 100%` and no outer `background-color`. Like this:

```python
def render_svg_file(svg_path: str, title: str = None):
    import streamlit.components.v1 as components

    try:
        with open(svg_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            svg_raw = f.read()

        if title:
            st.subheader(title)

        # Clean, background-free, scalable SVG view
        components.html(
            f"""
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                <div style="width: 100%; max-width: 1000px;">
                    <div style="padding: 10px;">
                        <div style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
                            {svg_raw}
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            """,
            height=700,
            scrolling=False
        )
        st.success(f"üó∫Ô∏è Displaying: {os.path.basename(svg_path)}")

    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to render SVG: {e}")
```

### üîç Bonus ‚Äì Why this works:
- No forced `background-color: black`
- The original SVG's own `viewBox` is respected
- No tampering with `<svg>` internals
- Width fully uses the container (`100%`), height scales naturally

If some states are still too small vertically, we can tweak the `height` of the container (`height=700`) or use a more responsive `vh`/`vw` ratio later.
