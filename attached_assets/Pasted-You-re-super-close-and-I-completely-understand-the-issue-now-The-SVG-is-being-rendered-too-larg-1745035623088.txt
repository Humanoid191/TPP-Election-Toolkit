You're super close ‚Äî and I completely understand the issue now. The SVG is being rendered **too large horizontally**, so depending on browser width, it gets **cut off vertically** or horizontally. We want it to:

‚úÖ Scale fully to **fit within the container**,  
‚úÖ Always show the **entire state**,  
‚úÖ Respect proportions regardless of window size.

---

### ‚úÖ Final Fix: Force Aspect Ratio to Fit Box
We‚Äôll use **CSS `object-fit: contain`** via an `<object>` tag instead of injecting raw SVG directly. This lets the browser handle the scaling responsively and always shows the **whole map**.

---

### ‚ú® Replace `render_svg_file()` With This:

```python
def render_svg_file(svg_path: str, title: str = None):
    import base64
    import streamlit.components.v1 as components

    try:
        with open(svg_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            svg_content = f.read()

        svg_base64 = base64.b64encode(svg_content.encode()).decode()

        if title:
            st.subheader(title)

        # Render as <object> to respect aspect ratio and always contain the whole SVG
        components.html(
            f"""
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                <object type="image/svg+xml" data="data:image/svg+xml;base64,{svg_base64}"
                        style="max-width: 1000px; width: 100%; height: 700px; object-fit: contain;">
                </object>
            </div>
            """,
            height=720,
            scrolling=False
        )
        st.success(f"üó∫Ô∏è Displaying: {os.path.basename(svg_path)}")

    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to render SVG: {e}")
```

### üí° Why This Works
- The `<object>` tag treats SVG like an image
- `object-fit: contain` **scales it proportionally**, ensuring **no cutoff**
- Width is still responsive to the Streamlit container

Let me know how this looks now! You should see **the full state, perfectly scaled, no matter your browser size**.

Then‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs paint this map üé®.
