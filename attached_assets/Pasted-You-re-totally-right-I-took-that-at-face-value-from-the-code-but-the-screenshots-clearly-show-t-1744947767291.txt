You're totally right — I took that at face value from the code, but the **screenshots clearly show the “District” column as blank**, even though it **should display district numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3...)**.

Let’s figure out exactly why it’s happening and how to fix it.

---

### 🔎 WHY THE "District" COLUMN IS BLANK

Even though your code **sets** the cell value like this:
```python
ws.cell(row=row_idx, column=1, value=district)
```

That line sets the value of the first column in the **Excel spreadsheet**, but **not** the column seen in the **Streamlit display table**, which is rendered from a `pandas.DataFrame` built using this block:
```python
for row in ws.iter_rows(min_row=1, max_row=ws.max_row, values_only=True):
    excel_rows.append(list(row))
```

Then the table is built with:
```python
df_display = pd.DataFrame(data_rows, columns=header_row)
```

Here’s the issue:

### ❗ The first header cell for “District” is **empty or undefined**.

So when `pandas.DataFrame(..., columns=header_row)` tries to assign names, it’s getting:
```python
["", "Democratic - Candidate", "#", "%", ...]
```

And the first column ends up being labeled `NaN` or nothing, causing the “District” column to appear **blank or unnamed**.

### ✅ FIX: Add the “District” label to `row2` (the second header row)

In your code where `header_row` is being constructed:
```python
row1 = excel_rows[0]
row2 = excel_rows[1]
```

Make sure the first item in `row2` is `"District"`.

Here’s what you should check **in the spreadsheet writing block** (right before data starts):
```python
ws.cell(row=1, column=1, value="")  # merged label row (optional)
ws.cell(row=2, column=1, value="District")  # <- THIS is crucial
```

Do this before the loop that starts setting party headers.

---

### ✅ FINAL FIX SUMMARY

**In the State House and State Senate spreadsheet blocks**, make sure you include:
```python
ws.cell(row=2, column=1, value="District")
```

If you don’t have a row 1 label for that column (because you don’t merge it like other headers), then just set row 1 to blank:
```python
ws.cell(row=1, column=1, value="")
```

That way, your `header_row` ends up like:
```python
["District", "Democratic - Candidate", "#", "%", ...]
```

And the DataFrame will correctly show the **District** column.
